\begin{itemize}
 \item importance of aerosols for health, climate..
 \item aerosols uncertainty due to high variability in space and time at different scales
 \item in addition to seasonal variability, variability at a longer time-scale. Importance of assessing the aerosol trends.
 \item sources of variability: anthropogenic emissions (development of emergent countries VS environmental protection programs: e.g: Clean Air Act), changes in meteorological conditions that parameterize the emissions of natural aerosols and the wet and dry deposition of aerosols.
 \item the ground based observation of the aerosols is organized in different networks. The remote sensing networks provide optical properties of the aerosols in the total air column, while in situ measurements provide particles measurements at the surface level. Using both of these information allow to depict a more complete picture of the changes in the aerosol content.
 \item what do the aerosol trends look like as seen from these observation networks?
 \item do the models reproduce the aerosol trends?
 \item can we use models to assess the global aerosol trends?
 \item in regards of the availability of the data used in this study, start in 2000. Last year of CMIP6 historical runs: 2000 -> study period: 2000-2014.

\subsection{Observations}

A set of 9 optical and micro-physical parameters is used in this study. Coming from different observation networks:

\begin{itemize}
 \item **AERONET website** The AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) project is a federation of ground-based remote sensing aerosol networks established by NASA and PHOTONS (PHOtométrie pour le Traitement Opérationnel de Normalisation Satellitaire; Univ. of Lille 1, CNES, and CNRS-INSU) and is greatly expanded by networks (e.g., RIMA, AeroSpan, AEROCAN, and CARSNET) and collaborators from national agencies, institutes, universities, individual scientists, and partners. For more than 25 years, the project has provided long-term, continuous and readily accessible public domain database of aerosol optical, microphysical and radiative properties for aerosol research and characterization, validation of satellite retrievals, and synergism with other databases. The network imposes standardization of instruments, calibration, processing and distribution.
       ** USED IN THIS STUDY AERONET: level2.0 (quality assured), version 3**
       \begin{itemize}
        \item AOD: od550aer
        \item AOD<1µm: od550lt1aer
        \item AOD>1µm: od550lg1aer
        \item AE: ang4487aer
       \end{itemize}
 \item **EBAS website** EBAS is a database hosting observation data of atmospheric chemical composition and physical properties. EBAS hosts data submitted by data originators in support of a number of national and international programs ranging from monitoring activities to research projects. EBAS is developed and operated by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU).
 **USED IN THIS STUDY EBAS: level 2, use nan flags, and remove outliers**
       \begin{itemize}
        \item PM2.5 (µg.m-3)
        \item PM10 (µg.m-3)
        \item Scattering coefficient: dry
        \item Absorption coefficient: removed Alert station (unit issue)
       \end{itemize}
 \item GAW/TAD + EANET (Aas et al.): $SO_{4}$ (µg.m-3): surface concentration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Models}

**Describe model groups**
A set of 11 climate models are used in this study. Their main characteristics are reported in table \ref{table:models}.  One can separate them into three groups:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CAMS-Reanalysis: w. data assimilation
    \item AP3 (historical runs): required output: + additional output for some models, which permits to cover the 9 aerosol parameters
    \item CMIP6: required output: od550aer time series from xxxx to 2014.
    Also, nudged / not-nudged within AP3?
\end{itemize}

 \caption{Observations and regions used in this study. The numbers reported within each region correspond to the maximum number of stations given for each observation network.}
 \label{map_obs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Constrains}
Filtering ephemere stations: at least 300 days (get rid of AERONET DRAGON stations)
Minimum number of points required in one timestamp: 3
Then, computation of median, first and third quartiles
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=12cm]{../scripts/figs/ts/panel-od550aer.png}
 \caption{Regional time series of observed AOD. The dark blue line and the light blue envelope correspond respectively to the median and the first and third quartiles of all the points available at the corresponding timestamp. The blue dots correspond to the yearly average, which is used to compute the linear trend, displayed as a continous or dashed line when the trend is significant or not.}
 \label{ts_aod}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Trends calculation}

\subsubsection{Regional time series computation}
The trends are calculated using the time series constructed with the yearly averages. This allows to prevent any disturbance in the calculation of the trend slope that would be induced by the presence of seasonal cycles, which are observed for most of the aerosol parameters. The computation of the yearly averages is obtained by applying step-by-step time constrains in order to insure the robustness of these averages. Starting with the finest resolution available, monthly, seasonal and yearly averages are computed as following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item monthly average if at least 5 days are available in the month (when daily observations are available).
 \item seasonal average if 1 month is available in the season.
 \item yearly average if 4 seasons are available in the year.
\end{itemize}
Compromise between availability of the measurements and the robustness of the yearly statistics.

\subsubsection{Trends computation}
Use of yearly averages. Computation if at least 7 points in the time series (50\% of time coverage). That's why, even though 25 stations provide AOD measurements in SAFRICA, no trend is provided in this region. For the models which provide output every 5 years (in addition to 2014), the trends are computed using 4 points (2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014).

Trends significance with Mann-Kendall.
Slope calculation: Theil-Sen estimator.
Uncertainty on the slope: combination of the Theil-Sen slope error and the error on the residuals.
The trend is provided as a relative trends (\%/yr) as respect to the first year of the time period (2000).

\subsection{Representativity of the trends}
The number of available points used to compute the regional time series is not constant in time. Usually, more stations are integrated within the observations networks in time, but also can be affected by the season depending on the nature of the measurements. For instance, sun-photometers are performing measurements in the daytime. Due to seasonal daylight and clouds conditions variations, clear seasonal cycles are observed for AOD: time representativity.
Also, one provides the trends for large regions, but data are available over a limited number of stations: space representativity.
In order to investigate both these source of uncertainties, one use model data in two experiments for each of whom the trends computed over one reference ($Ref$) and one experiment ($Exp$) will be compared together.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Time representativity experiment
       \begin{itemize}
        \item $Ref_{t}$: Collocation in space and time
        \item $Exp_{t}$: Collocation in space using complete time-series
       \end{itemize}
 \item Space representativity experiment
       \begin{itemize}
        \item $Ref_{s}$: Collocation in space using complete time-series (=$Exp_{t}$)
        \item $Exp_{s}$: All grid-points in region using full time-series
       \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For each parameter and over each region, one calculates the mean difference in the relative trends of these experiments is then converted into a score by using a normal distribution $f(\mu=0, \sigma=0.5)$. For a given parameter $p$ and a region $r$, the Representativity $Rep(p,r)$ is calculated as following

\begin{equation}
 Rep(p, r) = f\left( \frac{\left| s_{Exp_{t}(p, r)}-s_{Ref_{t}(p, r)} \right| + \left| s_{Exp_{s}(p, r)}-s_{Ref_{s}(p, r)}\right| }{2} \right)
\end{equation}

where $s$ corresponds to the relative trend of each dataset.

By doing so, a difference of 0.0\%/yr is giving a representativity of 100\%, and a difference of 0.5\%/yr is giving a representativity of 50\%.

\begin{figure}[t]
 \includegraphics[width=12cm]{../scripts/figs/representativity.png}
 \caption{Representativity of the regional AOD time series for the computation of trends. The upper figures correspond to the number of points used to compute the regional time series. The lower figures show the time series, the trends, and the resulting representativity. *MIGHT BE IN SUPP?*}
 \label{representativity}
\end{figure}

There is no filtering of the ocean grid-points while computing the representativity of the different parameters in the different regions. For this region, the regions that contain a larger proportion of ocean grid-points, where the trends are most likely to differ from the trends observed over land, will have a lower spatial representativity. This is the case for NAMERICA and WORLD.

Give some main results on the representativity itself:
- AE has a better representativity than AOD event though same number of observations.
- Insitu measurements, has usually a good time representativity, since regular measurements in every season, but low space representativity (few stations).

 \caption{Regional trends of the aerosol properties in both observations and models. The error bars correspond to the uncertainty of the trend as computed using both the uncertainty on the Theil−Sen slope and the residuals. The models are ordered according to the number of output used in this study.}

\subsection{Trends in models}

\subsubsection{Global trends}

Since we know how well we the model trends compare to the trends in the observations, one compute in this section the trends from the models for the whole time period and at a global scale. With the representativity study, we've seen that the trends computed at the stations could lead to a different trend than the computed in this region when all grid-points were considered. How do these both time and spacial representativity affect the computation of the global trends?

Since global trends, here we just process the average of all the trends computed at each grid-point (and at each grid-point where an observation station is located).

Trends computed with model regridded at a 2x2 degree resolution.

The relative trends are calculated by averaging the absolute trends within the considered grid-points and normalizing it to the global mean for 2000.}

\subsubsection{Can we explain the trends in AOD?}

REMARK: the trends in od550so4 and in concso4 have opposite directions in both GEOS and ECHAM-HAM models (see website)!
AND we also observe opposite trends in SO OD and emissions =)

\conclusions  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]
TEXT
\begin{itemize}
 \item Ground based observation networks are more or less representative for computing regional trends.
 \item The models reproduce pretty well the observed trends. Some examples with best/worst match.
 \item Great differences in global trends when considering only observation stations or using all grid-points --> Use of satellites. How long are the time series now?
 \item What about seasonal trends?
\end{itemize}
