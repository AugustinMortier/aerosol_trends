\begin{itemize}
 \item importance of aerosols for health, climate..
 \item aerosols uncertainty due to high variability in space and time at different scales
 \item in addition to seasonal variability, variability at a longer time-scale. Importance of assessing the aerosol trends.
 \item sources of variability: anthropogenic emissions (development of emergent countries VS environmental protection programs: e.g: Clean Air Act), changes in meteorological conditions that parameterize the emissions of natural aerosols and the wet and dry deposition of aerosols.
 \item the ground based observation of the aerosols is organized in different networks. The remote sensing networks provide optical properties of the aerosols in the total air column, while in situ measurements provide particles measurements at the surface level. Using both of these information allow to depict a more complete picture of the changes in the aerosol content.
 \item what do the aerosol trends look like as seen from these observation networks?
 \item because of the role of aerosol on climate, it is of importance for the models to capture the aerosol trends in order to reproduce the climate trends. How do the models reproduce the aerosol trends?
 \item can we use models to assess the global aerosol trends?
 \item in regards of the availability of the data used in this study, start in 2000. Last year of CMIP6 historical runs: 2000 -> study period: 2000-2014.

\subsection{Observations}

We use the highest quality level available, apply non-validity flags and an outliers range (see corresponding bullet-point).

\subsubsection{Sunphotometer}
(AERONET website): The AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) project is a federation of ground-based remote sensing aerosol networks established by NASA and PHOTONS (PHOtométrie pour le Traitement Opérationnel de Normalisation Satellitaire; Univ. of Lille 1, CNES, and CNRS-INSU) and is greatly expanded by networks (e.g., RIMA, AeroSpan, AEROCAN, and CARSNET) and collaborators from national agencies, institutes, universities, individual scientists, and partners. For more than 25 years, the project has provided long-term, continuous and readily accessible public domain database of aerosol optical, microphysical and radiative properties for aerosol research and characterization, validation of satellite retrievals, and synergism with other databases. The network imposes standardization of instruments, calibration, processing and distribution.
** USED IN THIS STUDY AERONET: level2.0 (quality assured), version 3** + daily files+ remove outliers
\begin{itemize}
 \item AOD: od550aer - AeronetSun - validity range []
 \item AE: ang4487aer - AeronetSun - validity range []
 \item AOD<1µm: od550lt1aer - AeronetSDA - validity range []
 \item AOD>1µm: od550lg1aer - AeronetSDA - validity range []
\end{itemize}

All the following data have been downloaded via EBAS.
(EBAS website): EBAS is a database hosting observation data of atmospheric chemical composition and physical properties. EBAS hosts data submitted by data originators in support of a number of national and international programs ranging from monitoring activities to research projects. EBAS is developed and operated by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU).

Add time resolution for each of the parameters.

\subsubsection{Particule Matter}
GAW (GAW website): The Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of WMO is a partnership involving the Members of WMO, contributing networks and collaborating organizations and bodies which provides reliable scientific data and information on the chemical composition of the atmosphere, its natural and anthropogenic change, and helps to improve the understanding of interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans and the biosphere.
\begin{itemize}
 \item $PM_{10}$ (\unit{µg.m^{-3}}) - Validity range: []
 \item $PM_{2.5}$ (\unit{µg.m^{-3}}) - Validity range: []
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{$SO_{4}$ concentration}
(trends website): The global dataset is prepared by the WMO/GAW Science Advisory Group for Total Atmospheric Deposition (SAG-TAD) based on data from different regional and global networks:
\begin{itemize}
 \item WMO/GAW: World Data Center for Precipitation Chemistry
 \item CASTNET: Clean Air Status and Trends Network
 \item NADP: National Atmospheric Deposition Program
 \item CAPMoN: The Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network
 \item EMEP: The European Monitoring and Evaluation Program
 \item IDAF/DEBITS: Atmospheric Chemistry Monitoring Network in Africa / DEposition of Biogeochemically Important Trace Species
 \item EANET: Acid Deposition Network in East Asia
\end{itemize}

Subset from Aas et al.
The data has been screened to be regional representative and of satisfactory quality:
Precipitation measurements are mainly from wet-only samplers or bulk if proven comparable to wet-only.
The sampling frequency is 2 weeks or higher –mostly daily measurements, except African data where precipitation is sampled on rain events and SO2 with monthly passive samplers.
Wet deposition and volume weighted precipitation data are based are based on the standard rain gauge depth if that is measured in parallel. At other sites without rain gauge, the sample depth are used.
Urban sites are not included, neither sites where the surroundings have changed considerable in the period in question.
When averaging monthly data with higher sampling frequency than daily, the sample is weighted in accordance to how many days it has been sampled in that month.

 \item Scattering coefficient (\unit{Mm^{-1}}): from nephelometer - dry -> RH<30\%? - Validity range: []
 \item Absorption coefficients (\unit{Mm^{-1}}): from aethalometer - validity range: [] - Validity range: [] - Removed Alert station (unit issue).
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Regional time series}
Due to the nature of the processes involved in the emission and the deposition of aerosols, one can expect different trends in the different regions of the World.
Instead of assembling the trends obtained at each individual observation station in a given region, regional time series are computed by assembling the measurements. This makes sense if the regions are not too big. An advantage is that one single trend can be computed in a given region, with an associated significance and uncertainty, which is not possible to get when combining trends together.

\subsubsection{Regions definition}
Seven regions, defined by a range of latitudes and longitudes, are considered in this study. The definitions of these regions allow to restrict the study to a limited number of geographic areas with, however, a global coverage when considering the ensemble of the regions. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:map_obs}, the regions do not have a similar coverage in terms of observations. North-America and Europe have the highest concentration of instruments.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Sunphotometers: most homogeneous spatial network. In this study, more than 1000 instruments are used over the World. The highest density in Europe and central part of North-America (US). Lowest density in South-Africa and Australia.
 \item Particule Matter: 212 instruments spread over Europe and North America. Note that in North-America, EBAS data only until 2006.
 \item $SO_{4}$: 346 instruments in North-America, Europe, Asia and North-Africa
 \item Scat. Coef. and Abs. Coef.: about 50 stations in total spread over North-America, Europe, North-Africa and Asia.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=12cm]{../scripts/figs/maps/av_obs.png}
 \caption{Observations and regions used in this study. The numbers reported within each region correspond to the maximum number of stations given for each observation network.}
 \label{fig:map_obs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Constrains}
Common filtering among all the parameters: use the highest quality level available, and remove outliers (see corresponding bullet point).

The regional time series are computed by combining, for each timestamp, the data of all the stations available in the corresponding region, for the same timestamp.
In order to compute robust regional time series, some additional constrains have been applied to the data:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The mountains sites have been removed.
 \item Filtering of ephemera stations (e.g AERONET DRAGON stations): a minimum of 300 days is required per station.
 \item Minimum of 3 points (stations with valid measurement) required per timestamp.
\end{itemize}

When those criteria are fulfilled, the median, as well as the first and third quartiles are computed at the finest time-resolution possible. The quartiles allow to capture the inter-regional variability. An example of regional time-series is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ts_aod} for the AOD.

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=16cm]{../scripts/figs/ts/panel-od550aer.png}
 \caption{Regional time series of AOD. The dark blue line and the light blue envelope correspond respectively to the median and the first and third quartiles of all the valid points at the corresponding timestamp. The blue dots correspond to the yearly averages which are used to compute the linear trend, displayed as a continuous or dashed line when the trend is significant or not.}
 \label{fig:ts_aod}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Trends calculation}

\subsubsection{Regional time series computation}
The trends are calculated using the time series constructed with the yearly averages. This allows to prevent any disturbance in the calculation of the trend slope that would be induced by the presence of seasonal cycles, which are observed for most of the aerosol parameters. The computation of the yearly averages is obtained by applying step-by-step time constrains in order to insure the robustness of the statistics. By starting at the finest time resolution available, monthly, seasonal and yearly averages are computed is the following criteria are fulfilled:
\begin{itemize}
 \item at least 5 days per month (when daily observations are available).
 \item at least 1 month per season.
 \item at least 4 seasons per year.
\end{itemize}
This gives a reasonable compromise between the availability of the measurements and the robustness of the yearly statistics.

\subsubsection{Trends computation}
Use of yearly averages. Computation if at least 7 points in the time series (50\% of time coverage). That's why, even though 25 stations provide AOD measurements in SAFRICA, no trend is provided in this region since the regional time series contains only 6? points (clean up the website). The trends are computed similarly for observation and model datasets. However, since some models provide output every 5 years (in addition to 2014), the minimum number of points has been reduced to 4 for the models, so the trends can be computed using the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014.

Same methodology as in \cite{aas2019global}.
Trends significance with Mann-Kendall.
Slope calculation with Theil-Sen estimator.
Uncertainty on the slope: combination of the Theil-Sen slope error and the error on the residuals.
The trend is provided as a relative trend (\%/yr) as respect to the first year of the time period (2000).

\subsection{Representativity of the trends}
The number of available points used to compute the regional time series is not constant in time. Usually, more stations are integrated within the observations networks in time, but also can be affected by the season depending on the nature of the measurements. For instance, sun-photometers are performing measurements in the daytime. Due to seasonal daylight and clouds conditions variations, clear seasonal cycles are observed for AOD: time representativity.
Also, one provides the trends for large regions, but data are available over a limited number of stations: space representativity.
In order to investigate both these sources of uncertainty, model data are used in two different time and space studies for each of whom the trends, computed for one reference ($Ref$) and one experiment ($Exp$) dataset, are compared together.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Time representativity study
       \begin{itemize}
        \item $Ref_{time}$: Collocation in space and time
        \item $Exp_{time}$: Collocation in space using complete time-series
       \end{itemize}
 \item Space representativity study
       \begin{itemize}
        \item $Ref_{space}$: Collocation in space using complete time-series (=$Exp_{t}$)
        \item $Exp_{space}$: All grid-points in region using full time-series
       \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The difference between the relative trends are computed for each parameter and over each region. Those differences are then converted into a score (\unit{\%}) by using a normal distribution $f$ described by a mean $\mu=0$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma=0.5$. For a given parameter $p$ and a region $r$, the Representativity $Rep(p,r)$ is calculated as following

\begin{equation}
 Rep_{space,time}(p, r) = {f\left(\left| trend_{Exp_{space,time}(p, r)}-trend_{Ref_{space,time}(p, r)} \right|\right)}
\end{equation}

For a given study, a difference of 0.0\%/yr as compared to its reference dataset leads to a representativity of 100\%, and a difference of 0.5\%/yr leads to a representativity of 50\%.
Finally, the total representativity is computed as the mean of the time and the space representativities.

An example of representativity calculation is presented in Appendix \ref{sec:representativity}.

Give some main results on the representativity itself:
- AE has a better representativity than AOD event though same number of observations.
- Insitu measurements, has usually a good time representativity, since regular measurements in every season, but low space representativity (few stations).

\subsection{Trends in models}

\subsubsection{Global trends}
Since we know how well we the model trends compare to the trends in the observations, one compute in this section the trends from the models for the whole time period and at a global scale. With the representativity study, we've seen that the trends computed at the stations could lead to a different trend than the computed in this region when all grid-points were considered. How do these both time and spacial representativity affect the computation of the global trends?

Since global trends, it does not make sens to compute a regional time series. Instead, we process the average of all the trends computed at each grid-point (and at each grid-point where an observation station is located).

\conclusions  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]
TEXT
\begin{itemize}
 \item Ground based observation networks are more or less representative for computing regional trends.
 \item The models reproduce pretty well the observed trends. Some examples with best/worst match.
 \item Great differences in global trends when considering only observation stations or using all grid-points --> Use of satellites. How long are the time series now?
 \item What about seasonal trends? For instance, AOD time series for SAMERICA reveal strong cycles for which the local maximum is decreasing significantly in time. The trend could be driven by a decrease of the extreme events *Is it consistent with the expected increasing forest fires?*

\appendix
\section{Representativity study} \label{sec:representativity} %% Appendix A

The Figure \ref{fig:representativity} shows an example of the repesentativity of the AOD measurements in Europe and North-America for the computation of the trends in 2000-2014.

The $Ref_{t}$ dataset reveals in both regions strong seasonal cycles for the number of points used to compute the regional time-series. This comes from the nature of the AOD measurements, which are obtained during daytime, while amount of daylight is minimum in wintertime in the Northern Hemisphere. Together with this seasonal cycle, one observe an increase with time, that reflect the increasing number of stations within each region.

The ocean grid-points are not filtered while computing the representativity of the different parameters in the different regions of the World. For this reason, the regions containing a larger proportion of ocean grid-points, where the trends are most likely to differ from the trends observed over land, will have a lower spatial representativity. This probably explains why North America has a low representativity, especially considering the spatial part.
