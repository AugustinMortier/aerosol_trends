\subsection{Regional time series}
TEXT

 \caption{Observations and regions used in this study. The numbers reported within each region correspond to the maximum number of stations given for each observation network.}
 \label{map_obs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Constrains}
Filtering ephemere stations: at least 300 days (get rid of AERONET DRAGON stations)
Minimum number of points required in one timestamp: 3
Then, computation of median, first and third quartiles
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../scripts/figs/ts/panel-od550aer.png}
 \caption{Regional time series of observed AOD. The dark blue line and the light blue envelope correspond respectively to the median and the first and third quartiles of all the points available at the corresponding timestamp. The blue dots correspond to the yearly average, which is used to compute the linear trend, displayed as a continous or dashed line when the trend is significant or not.}
 \label{ts_aod}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Trends calculation}

\subsubsection{Regional time series computation}
The trends are calculated using the time series constructed with the yearly averages. This allows to prevent any disturbance in the calculation of the trend slope that would be induced by the presence of seasonal cycles, which are observed for most of the aerosol parameters. The computation of the yearly averages is obtained by applying step-by-step time constrains in order to insure the robustness of these averages. Starting with the finest resolution available, monthly, seasonal and yearly averages are computed as following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item monthly average if at least 5 days are available in the month (when daily observations are available).
 \item seasonal average if 1 month is available in the season.
 \item yearly average if 4 seasons are available in the year.
\end{itemize}
Compromise between availability of the measurements and the robustness of the yearly statistics.

\subsubsection{Trends computation}
Use of yearly averages. Computation if at least 7 points in the time series (50\% of time coverage). That's why, even though 25 stations provide AOD measurements in SAFRICA, no trend is provded in this region.

Trends significance with Mann-Kendall.
Slope calclation: Theil-Sen estimator.
Uncertainty on the slope: combination of the Theil-Sen slope error and the error on the residuals.
The trend is provided as a relative trends (\%/yr) as respect to the first year of the time period (2000).

\subsection{Representativity of the trends}
The number of available points used to compute the regional time series is not constant in time. Usually, more stations are integrated within the observations networks in time, but also can be affected by the season depending on the nature of the measurements. For instance, sun-photometers are performing measurements in the daytime. Due to seasonal daylight and clouds conditions variations, clear seasonal cycles are observed for AOD: time representativity.
Also, one provides the trends for large regions, but data are available over a limited number of stations: space representativity.
In order to investigate both these source of uncertainties, one use model data in two experiments for each of whom the trends computed over one reference ($Ref$) and one experiment ($Exp$) will be compared together.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Time representativity experiment
       \begin{itemize}
        \item $Ref_{t}$: Collocation in space and time
        \item $Exp_{t}$: Collocation in space using complete time-series
       \end{itemize}
 \item Space representativity experiment
       \begin{itemize}
        \item $Ref_{s}$: Collocation in space using complete time-series (=$Exp_{t}$)
        \item $Exp_{s}$: All grid-points in region using full time-series
       \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For each parameter and over each region, one calculates the mean difference in the relative trends of these experiments is then converted into a score by using a normal distribution $f(\mu=0, \sigma=0.5)$. For a given parameter $p$ and a region $r$, the Representativity $Rep(p,r)$ is calculated as following

\begin{equation}
 Rep(p, r) = f\left( \frac{\left| s_{Exp_{t}(p, r)}-s_{Ref_{t}(p, r)} \right| + \left| s_{Exp_{s}(p, r)}-s_{Ref_{s}(p, r)}\right| }{2} \right)
\end{equation}

where $s$ corresponds to the relative trend of each dataset.

By doing so, a difference of 0.0\%/yr is giving a representativity of 100\%, and a difference of 0.5\%/yr is giving a representativity of 50\%.

 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../scripts/figs/representativity.png}
 \caption{Representativity of the regional AOD time series for the computation of trends. The upper figures correspond to the number of points used to compute the regional time series. The lower figures show the time series, the trends, and the resulting representa}
 \label{representativity}
\end{figure}

There is no filtering of the ocean grid-points while computing the representativity of the different parameters in the different regions. For this region, the regions that contain a larger proportion of ocean grid-points, where the trends are most likely to differ from the trends observed over land, will have a lower spatial representativity. This is the case for NAMERICA and WORLD.

Give some main results on the representativity itself:
- AE has a better representativity than AOD event though same number of observations.
- Insitu measurements, has usually a good time representativity, since regular measurements in every season, but low space representativity (few stations).

\subsection{Trends in models}

\subsubsection{Global trends}

Since we know how well we the model trends compare to the trends in the observations, one compute in this section the trends from the models for the whole time period and at a global scale. With the representativity study, we've seen that the trends computed at the stations could lead to a different trend than the computed in this region when all grid-points were considered. How do these both time and spacial representativity affect the computation of the global trends?

Since global trends, here we just process the average of all the trends computed at each grid-point (and at each grid-point where an observation station is located).

Trends computed with model regridded at a 2x2 degree resolution.
